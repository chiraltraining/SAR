# Variables (Identifiers) in R
# Variables are used to store data, and R allows dynamic assignment of types.

# Creating Variables
x = 10            # Using equal (=) operator
y <- 15           # Using leftward (<-) operator
a <- 30 
age <- 30 

# Naming Conventions for Variables in R
new.name <- "Doe"             # period.separated
my_name <- "John_Doe"         # underscore_separated (standard)

# Reserved Keywords in R
# Reserved words in R cannot be used as variable names.
?Reserved                   # List of reserved keywords in R

# Examples of invalid variable names
TRUE <- "Today is Friday"
1var <- 30    # Invalid: starts with a number
my-variable <- 20   # Invalid: contains a hyphen
