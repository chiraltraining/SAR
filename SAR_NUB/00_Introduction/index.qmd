## What is R?
- R is a language and environment for statistical computing and graphics developed in 1991.

- R is the open source implementation of the [S language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S_(programming_language)), which was developed by [Bell laboratories](https://ca.slack-edge.com/T023TPZA8LF-U024EN26Q0L-113294823b2c-512) in the 70s.

- The aim of the S language, as expressed by John Chambers, is "to turn ideas into software, quickly and faithfully"

- R is both [open source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source) and [open development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_software_development).
- The aim of the S language, as expressed by John Chambers, is "to turn ideas into software, quickly and faithfully"

```

## Why R?

* Free (open source)

* High level language designed for statistical computing

* Powerful and flexible - especially for data wrangling and visualization

* Extensive add-on software (packages)
* R is popular â€“ and increasing in popularity. 
* R runs on all platforms.(Windows, Linux and Mac) 
* R is being used by the biggest tech giants(google, facebook, microsoft, twitter)
* Strong community
