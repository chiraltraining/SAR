As of tidyverse 1.3.0, the following packages are included in the core tidyverse:\n\n\n\n\n\nThe dplyr package in R provides a concise grammar of data manipulation, offering consistent verbs for common tasks. Key functions include select() to extract columns, filter() to subset rows, mutate() to create or modify variables, arrange() to sort rows, and summarize() with group_by() for grouped aggregations. Additionally, rename() simplifies column renaming. These tools streamline data transformation, making workflows efficient and readable for modern data analysis in R.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe ggplot2 package in R is a powerful tool for data visualization, based on the grammar of graphics. It allows users to build plots layer by layer, starting with data and aesthetic mappings defined in ggplot(). Key layers include geom_ functions for adding geometric elements (e.g., geom_point() for scatterplots, geom_bar() for bar charts), facet_ functions for creating subplots, and theme() for customizing appearances. Its flexibility in mapping data to visual elements, combined with a rich set of options for customization, makes ggplot2 a cornerstone of exploratory and presentation-ready visualizations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe tidyr package in R is designed for tidying data, ensuring it is in a consistent, tidy format where each variable is a column and each observation is a row. Key functions include pivot_longer() to convert wide data into long format, pivot_wider() for the reverse transformation, separate() to split a single column into multiple, and unite() to combine multiple columns into one. These functions enable efficient reshaping and restructuring of data, facilitating better data analysis and preparation for modeling or visualization tasks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe readr package in R provides fast and efficient functions for reading and writing data. It simplifies importing data from various file formats, such as CSV, TSV, and fixed-width files, with functions like read_csv(), read_tsv(), and read_fwf(). These functions automatically handle common data issues such as type conversion and missing values. Additionally, readr provides write_csv() and write_tsv() for exporting data, ensuring compatibility with other tools while maintaining efficiency and consistency in data import/export tasks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe stringr package in R provides a set of consistent and user-friendly functions for string manipulation. It simplifies common tasks such as detecting patterns with str_detect(), extracting substrings with str_extract(), and replacing text with str_replace(). Additionally, stringr offers functions like str_sub() for substring extraction, str_length() for string length, and str_c() for concatenating strings. These functions help streamline text processing, ensuring consistency and efficiency when working with string data.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe forcats package in R is designed for working with categorical data, specifically factors. It provides functions for reordering, recoding, and combining factor levels in a straightforward way. Key functions include fct_reorder() to reorder factor levels based on another variable, fct_lump() to combine infrequent levels, fct_recode() for renaming factor levels, and fct_drop() to remove unused levels. forcats helps manage and manipulate factors effectively, ensuring clean and meaningful categorical data for analysis and visualization.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe easystats package in R is a collection of tools designed to simplify the process of statistical analysis, reporting, and visualization.

    "text": "Core packages\nIn R, several core packages provide essential tools for data manipulation, visualization, and analysis. These packages form the foundation of the R ecosystem, enabling efficient workflows and reproducible research.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe dplyr package in R provides a concise grammar of data manipulation, offering consistent verbs for common tasks. Key functions include select() to extract columns, filter() to subset rows, mutate() to create or modify variables, arrange() to sort rows, and summarize() with group_by() for grouped aggregations. Additionally, rename() simplifies column renaming. These tools streamline data transformation, making workflows efficient and readable for modern data analysis in R.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe ggplot2 package in R is a powerful tool for data visualization, based on the grammar of graphics. It allows users to build plots layer by layer, starting with data and aesthetic mappings defined in ggplot(). Key layers include geom_ functions for adding geometric elements (e.g., geom_point() for scatterplots, geom_bar() for bar charts), facet_ functions for creating subplots, and theme() for customizing appearances. Its flexibility in mapping data to visual elements, combined with a rich set of options for customization, makes ggplot2 a cornerstone of exploratory and presentation-ready visualizations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe tidyr package in R is designed for tidying data, ensuring it is in a consistent, tidy format where each variable is a column and each observation is a row. Key functions include pivot_longer() to convert wide data into long format, pivot_wider() for the reverse transformation, separate() to split a single column into multiple, and unite() to combine multiple columns into one. These functions enable efficient reshaping and restructuring of data, facilitating better data analysis and preparation for modeling or visualization tasks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe readr package in R provides fast and efficient functions for reading and writing data. It simplifies importing data from various file formats, such as CSV, TSV, and fixed-width files, with functions like read_csv(), read_tsv(), and read_fwf(). These functions automatically handle common data issues such as type conversion and missing values. Additionally, readr provides write_csv() and write_tsv() for exporting data, ensuring compatibility with other tools while maintaining efficiency and consistency in data import/export tasks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe stringr package in R provides a set of consistent and user-friendly functions for string manipulation. It simplifies common tasks such as detecting patterns with str_detect(), extracting substrings with str_extract(), and replacing text with str_replace(). Additionally, stringr offers functions like str_sub() for substring extraction, str_length() for string length, and str_c() for concatenating strings. These functions help streamline text processing, ensuring consistency and efficiency when working with string data.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe forcats package in R is designed for working with categorical data, specifically factors. It provides functions for reordering, recoding, and combining factor levels in a straightforward way. Key functions include fct_reorder() to reorder factor levels based on another variable, fct_lump() to combine infrequent levels, fct_recode() for renaming factor levels, and fct_drop() to remove unused levels. forcats helps manage and manipulate factors effectively, ensuring clean and meaningful categorical data for analysis and visualization.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe easystats package in R is a collection of tools designed to simplify the process of statistical analysis, reporting, and visualization.
