    "section": "Core packages",
    "text": "Core packages\nIn R, several core packages provide essential tools for data manipulation, visualization, and analysis. These packages form the foundation of the R ecosystem, enabling efficient workflows and reproducible research.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe dplyr package in R provides a concise grammar of data manipulation, offering consistent verbs for common tasks. Key functions include select() to extract columns, filter() to subset rows, mutate() to create or modify variables, arrange() to sort rows, and summarize() with group_by() for grouped aggregations. Additionally, rename() simplifies column renaming. These tools streamline data transformation, making workflows efficient and readable for modern data analysis in R.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe ggplot2 package in R is a powerful tool for data visualization, based on the grammar of graphics. It allows users to build plots layer by layer, starting with data and aesthetic mappings defined in ggplot(). Key layers include geom_ functions for adding geometric elements (e.g., geom_point() for scatterplots, geom_bar() for bar charts), facet_ functions for creating subplots, and theme() for customizing appearances. Its flexibility in mapping data to visual elements, combined with a rich set of options for customization, makes ggplot2 a cornerstone of exploratory and presentation-ready visualizations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe tidyr package in R is designed for tidying data, ensuring it is in a consistent, tidy format where each variable is a column and each observation is a row. Key functions include pivot_longer() to convert wide data into long format, pivot_wider() for the reverse transformation, separate() to split a single column into multiple, and unite() to combine multiple columns into one. These functions enable efficient reshaping and restructuring of data, facilitating better data analysis and preparation for modeling or visualization tasks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe readr package in R provides fast and efficient functions for reading and writing data. It simplifies importing data from various file formats, such as CSV, TSV, and fixed-width files, with functions like read_csv(), read_tsv(), and read_fwf(). These functions automatically handle common data issues such as type conversion and missing values. Additionally, readr provides write_csv() and write_tsv() for exporting data, ensuring compatibility with other tools while maintaining efficiency and consistency in data import/export tasks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe stringr package in R provides a set of consistent and user-friendly functions for string manipulation. It simplifies common tasks such as detecting patterns with str_detect(), extracting substrings with str_extract(), and replacing text with str_replace(). Additionally, stringr offers functions like str_sub() for substring extraction, str_length() for string length, and str_c() for concatenating strings. These functions help streamline text processing, ensuring consistency and efficiency when working with string data.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe forcats package in R is designed for working with categorical data, specifically factors. It provides functions for reordering, recoding, and combining factor levels in a straightforward way. Key functions include fct_reorder() to reorder factor levels based on another variable, fct_lump() to combine infrequent levels, fct_recode() for renaming factor levels, and fct_drop() to remove unused levels. forcats helps manage and manipulate factors effectively, ensuring clean and meaningful categorical data for analysis and visualization.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe easystats package in R is a collection of tools designed to simplify the process of statistical analysis, reporting, and visualization. It provides a unified interface for working with various statistical models and outputs, making it easier to interpret and communicate results. Key functions include parameters() for extracting model parameters, performance() for assessing model fit, and effectsize() for calculating effect sizes. Additionally, easystats offers functions for model comparisons, diagnostics, and visualizations, streamlining the workflow for both beginners and advanced users in statistical analysis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe gtsummary package in R is designed for creating publication-ready summary tables from statistical models and data. It allows users to easily summarize data, describe statistics, and present results in a clear, formatted table. Key functions include tbl_summary() for descriptive statistics of datasets, tbl_regression() for summarizing regression model results, and tbl_uvregression() for univariate regression analyses. The package supports customization of table styles, variable transformations, and statistical tests, making it a valuable tool for producing professional reports and visual summaries in clinical and social science research.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe gt package in R is used for creating beautiful, customizable tables for data presentation. It allows users to easily create tables from data frames or tibbles with functions like gt() to initiate the table and tab_spanner() for grouping columns. Users can apply various formatting options, such as color, bold, and font styles, to enhance the table‚Äôs readability using functions like tab_style() and tab_footnote(). gt also supports features like adding summary statistics, row/column grouping, and rendering tables in HTML or LaTeX for use in reports and publications.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuarto is an open-source, next-generation publishing system that enables users to create dynamic documents, reports, presentations, and websites.

    "text": "Course Modules\n\n\n\n\n\nModule 1\n\n\nFundamentals of R\n\n\n\nThis module covers the basics of R, including installation, environment setup, and core programming concepts. Learners will explore variables, data types, operators, conditional logic, loops, and essential data structures like vectors, factors, matrices, data frames, and lists‚Äîbuilding a strong foundation for data analysis in R.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nModule 2\n\n\nStatistics for Researchers\n\n\n\nThis module introduces fundamental statistical concepts essential for research. It covers descriptive statistics, probability distributions, hypothesis testing, correlation, regression analysis, and statistical inference. Learners will apply these techniques using R, gaining practical skills for data-driven research and decision-making.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nModule 3\n\n\nData Wrangling with R\n\n\n\nThis module focuses on data manipulation techniques essential for preparing and cleaning datasets. It covers data import/export, filtering, sorting, transforming, and reshaping using R‚Äôs powerful packages like dplyr and tidyr. Learners will develop hands-on skills to handle real-world data efficiently.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nModule 4\n\n\nPublication-ready and Reproducible Tables with R\n\n\n\nThis module focuses on creating high-quality, reproducible tables for research and publication using gtsummary and gt. Learners will explore techniques for summarizing data, formatting tables, and enhancing readability to meet journal and reporting standards.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nModule 5\n\n\nPublication-ready Data Visualization with R\n\n\n\nThis module covers the principles of effective data visualization for research and publication. Using ggplot2, learners will create high-quality graphs, customize aesthetics, and ensure clarity, reproducibility, and compliance with scientific reporting standards.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nModule 6\n\n\nReproducing a Scientific Article: A Practical Application\n\n\n\nThis module guides learners through the process of replicating a published scientific study using R. It covers data extraction, statistical analysis, visualization, and table generation to ensure reproducibility. By applying learned skills, participants will strengthen their ability to conduct transparent and replicable research.\n\n\n\n\n\nPublication-ready figures\nThe ggpubr package provides some easy-to-use functions for creating and customizing ‚Äòggplot2‚Äô- based publication ready plots. ggplot2, by Hadley Wickham, is an excellent and flexible package for elegant data visualization in R. However the default generated plots requires some formatting before we can send them for publication. Furthermore, to customize a ggplot, the syntax is opaque and this raises the level of difficulty for researchers with no advanced R programming skills.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPublication-ready tables\nThe gtsummary package provides an elegant and flexible way to create publication-ready analytical and summary tables using the R programming language. The {gtsummary} package summarizes data sets, regression models, and more, using sensible defaults with highly customizable capabilities.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnalysis and visualization likert items\nThe likert is an R package designed to help analyzing and visualizing Likert type items. It has been developped by Jason Bryer and Kim Speerschneider. This barplot comes from the demo page and has been sent by Carlos Ortega. It allows to analyse the reading attitudes from a panel of people.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReproducible academic writing with Rmarkdown/Quarto\nR Markdown documents are fully reproducible.
