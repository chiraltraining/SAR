# Introduction 

## Welcome! 
Welcome to the Statistical Analysis with R for Research Workshop! 
This 1-day intensive program is designed to equip researchers, students, and professionals with essential R programming skills for statistical analysis.

## Learning Objectives 

* `Data Manipulation:` Learn how to import, clean, and transform data in R for research purposes.
* `Data Visualization:` Master techniques for creating effective data visualizations in R to communicate research findings visually.
* `Statistical Analysis:` Develop skills in conducting statistical analysis using R for hypothesis testing, regression analysis, and other statistical tests.
* `Reproducible Research:` Implement principles of reproducible research using R to document and organize code, data, and analysis for replicability.


## Course Platforms

* Website: <https://chiraltraining.github.io/SAR/>
* Github: <https://github.com/chiraltraining/SAR> 

> We are constantly trying to improve content! Please refresh/download materials before class.

## Session Format

 * Lecture with live coding (possibly "Interactive")
 * Practical experience
 * 10-15 mins breaks each session - timing may vary



## Required Textbooks

The following books purchased and are available online!

# R Programming - What? Why? How?

## What is R?
- R is a language and environment for statistical computing and graphics developed in 1991.

- R is the open source implementation of the [S language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S_(programming_language)), which was developed by [Bell laboratories](https://ca.slack-edge.com/T023TPZA8LF-U024EN26Q0L-113294823b2c-512) in the 70s.

- The aim of the S language, as expressed by John Chambers, is "to turn ideas into software, quickly and faithfully"

- R is both [open source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source) and [open development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_software_development).
- The aim of the S language, as expressed by John Chambers, is "to turn ideas into software, quickly and faithfully"

```

## Why R?

* Free (open source)

* High level language designed for statistical computing

* Powerful and flexible - especially for data wrangling and visualization

* Extensive add-on software (packages)
* R is popular â€“ and increasing in popularity. 
* R runs on all platforms.(Windows, Linux and Mac) 
* R is being used by the biggest tech giants(google, facebook, microsoft, twitter)
* Strong community
