### Publication-ready figures
The `{ggpubr}` package provides some easy-to-use functions for creating and customizing ‚Äòggplot2‚Äô- based publication ready plots. ggplot2, by Hadley Wickham, is an excellent and flexible package for elegant data visualization in R. However the default generated plots requires some formatting before we can send them for publication. Furthermore, to customize a ggplot, the syntax is opaque and this raises the level of difficulty for researchers with no advanced R programming skills.


```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/ggpubr.png")
```

### Publication-ready tables 
The `{gtsummary}` package provides an elegant and flexible way to create publication-ready analytical and summary tables using the R programming language. The {gtsummary} package summarizes data sets, regression models, and more, using sensible defaults with highly customizable capabilities.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("images/gtsummary.gif")
```

### Analysis and visualization likert items
The `{likert}` is an R package designed to help analyzing and visualizing Likert type items. It has been developped by Jason Bryer and Kim Speerschneider. This barplot comes from the demo page and has been sent by Carlos Ortega. It allows to analyse the reading attitudes from a panel of people.

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/likert.png")
```

### Reproducible academic writing with Rmarkdown/Quarto
R Markdown documents are fully reproducible. Use a productive notebook interface to weave together narrative text and code to produce elegantly formatted output. Use multiple languages including R, Python, and SQL.

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/rmarkdown.png")
```

::: {.grid}
::: {.g-col-3}

![](images/stringr.png)
:::
::: {.g-col-9}
The `{stringr}` package in R provides a set of consistent and user-friendly functions for string manipulation. It simplifies common tasks such as detecting patterns with `str_detect()`, extracting substrings with `str_extract()`, and replacing text with `str_replace()`. Additionally, `stringr` offers functions like `str_sub()` for substring extraction, `str_length()` for string length, and `str_c()` for concatenating strings. These functions help streamline text processing, ensuring consistency and efficiency when working with string data.

::: {.grid}
::: {.g-col-3}

![](images/forcats.png)
:::
::: {.g-col-9}
The `{forcats}` package in R is designed for working with categorical data, specifically factors. It provides functions for reordering, recoding, and combining factor levels in a straightforward way. Key functions include `fct_reorder()` to reorder factor levels based on another variable, `fct_lump()` to combine infrequent levels, `fct_recode()` for renaming factor levels, and `fct_drop()` to remove unused levels. `forcats` helps manage and manipulate factors effectively, ensuring clean and meaningful categorical data for analysis and visualization.

![](images/easystats.png)
:::
::: {.g-col-9}
The `{easystats}` package in R is a collection of tools designed to simplify the process of statistical analysis, reporting, and visualization. It provides a unified interface for working with various statistical models and outputs, making it easier to interpret and communicate results. Key functions include `parameters()` for extracting model parameters, `performance()` for assessing model fit, and `effectsize()` for calculating effect sizes. Additionally, `easystats` offers functions for model comparisons, diagnostics, and visualizations, streamlining the workflow for both beginners and advanced users in statistical analysis.

::: {.grid}
::: {.g-col-3}
![](images/gtsummary.png)
:::
::: {.g-col-9}
The `{gtsummary}` package in R is designed for creating publication-ready summary tables from statistical models and data. It allows users to easily summarize data, describe statistics, and present results in a clear, formatted table. Key functions include `tbl_summary()` for descriptive statistics of datasets, `tbl_regression()` for summarizing regression model results, and `tbl_uvregression()` for univariate regression analyses. The package supports customization of table styles, variable transformations, and statistical tests, making it a valuable tool for producing professional reports and visual summaries in clinical and social science research.

::: {.grid}
::: {.g-col-3}
![](images/gt.jpg)
:::
::: {.g-col-9}
The `{gt}` package in R is used for creating beautiful, customizable tables for data presentation. It allows users to easily create tables from data frames or tibbles with functions like `gt()` to initiate the table and `tab_spanner()` for grouping columns. Users can apply various formatting options, such as color, bold, and font styles, to enhance the table‚Äôs readability using functions like `tab_style()` and `tab_footnote()`. `gt` also supports features like adding summary statistics, row/column grouping, and rendering tables in HTML or LaTeX for use in reports and publications.
